However, we currently make use of a library under the LGPL-3.0-only license, which is incompatible with the Apache-2.0 license,
meaning a binary built from this source code cannot be used under the terms of the Apache-2.0 terms.

The code in this directory, as well as the LGPL-3.0-only library, is not necessary for executing openDuT and
will remain that way until we have resolved the license issue.
